        <p>Sean Cliver’s Strangelove Skateboards have just dropped 3 rad super limited Ray Barbee Guest decks.
          Sean penned the original Powell Peralta Ray Barbee Rag Doll Deck graphic way back in 1989 and has revisited it
          here for this special Strangelove guest mini series.
          The 3 decks are called Classic, Legacy and What If…?
          Classic – As mentioned Cliver penned the original Powell Peralta Ray Barbee Rag Doll Graphic. This model the
          Strangelove Ray Barbee Classic Skateboard Deck runs the same colours as the original with the Cyan Blue Dip.
          Legacy – Sean celebrates the multiple different versions of the Rag Doll that he’s drawn over the years for
          the Strangelove Ray Barbee Legacy Skateboard Deck.
          What If…? – This graphic is a What If…? Ray Barbee went to World Industries back in the day. Sean reimagines
          it as if World had printed it in their Day Glo Fluorescent inks to give us the Strangelove Ray Barbee What
          If…? Skateboard Deck.</p>
